# SandSimulator
A simple ECS based voxel sand simulator in C#.


# TODO List:
* BUG: Dropping sand creates alternating sand and air causing "swap chain" when hitting water.  Move of two positions each move? Inability to place every other frame?
* BUG: Address multiple checks for the same position crashing inspect ('I')
* Predictable Order of traversal
* Add velocity of movement
* Add more natural stacking
* Wood
* Acid
* Gas
* Fire
* Embers
* Tiling
* Center Position that can be moved
* Proceedural world gen
* Ridgid body & Physics
* Player
